Impact of Climate Change on Maize Agricultural Yield in Kenya

correlation analysis on it to compare yield and key climate factors:
conclusion:

Strong Positive Correlation:

Production (1000 MT): Correlation coefficient = 0.713418
This indicates that production is closely related to yield, which is logical since an increase in yield generally results in higher production.

Moderate Positive Correlation:

temperature_2m_min (°C): Correlation coefficient = 0.402153
This suggests that an increase in minimum air temperature could have a positive effect on yield.

Weak Positive Correlation:

soil_temperature_level_4 (°C): Correlation coefficient = 0.26106
The soil temperature at a moderate depth may have a weak positive impact on yield.

surface_net_solar_radiation_sum (J/m^2): Correlation coefficient = -0.114411
A weak negative correlation, suggesting that an increase in surface solar radiation might slightly reduce yield.
